    "Let's create our own sample space using the Rev language. We'll begin by creating a vector in RevBayes. A vector is simply a list of values. To create a vector, we first give it a variable name (in this case, _sampleSpace_) and then assign the list of values to that variable name. An equals sign (_=_) is one of the assignment operators in RevBayes. It takes whatever is on the right and assigns it to the variable on the left. There are a few different ways to create a vector, but the simplest is probably to enclose a comma-separated list of values in square brackets [ . . . ]"

    "If we want to do something repetitious, like sample from our sample space many times, we'll want to use a construct called a _for_ loop. _for_ loops are ubiquitous across programming languages. They're structured so that they create a new variable (in this case, _i_) that takes on a different value every time you go through the code inside the loop. When you set up the loop, you both give the variable a name and you tell it what values you want it to take. In this case, we're taking advantage of some Rev shorthand (also used by R). If you type 1:4, it automatically creates a list of all values between 1 and 4. This syntax is handy when you're dealing with consecutive integers. The code to actually be executed as part of the loop is contained inside curly braces _{ . . .}_. If the loop variable (e.g., _i_) is used in this code, it will change values every time you run through the loop. In the simple example below, we're just printing out the value of _i_ every time we go through the loop."

    "Now let's set up a for loop to do something more interesting. But we need one more trick. RevBayes has a lot of built-in functions that we can call to do interesting things. These functions always have this form - _functionName()_. The name of the function is followed by parentheses. Most functions will also have options that affect how they run. These options can be changed by passing different arguments to a function. In that case, the syntax looks like this - _functionName(functionArguments)_. The possible arguments are always specific to that function. In our case, we're going to use a function called _runifInt()_. This name can be broken up into these three parts - _r_ (sample values from a distribution), _unif_ (in this case, use a uniform distribution), and _Int_ (more specifically, use a uniform distribution across only integers). A uniform distribution just means that we assign equal probability to all values included in the distribution. _runifInt_ takes three arguments - (1) the number of samples you want, (2) the lower bound on your uniform distribution, and (3) the upper bound on your uniform distribution. Using a for loop, we can see what it looks like to sample from this uniform distribution several times."

Sometimes, we just want to pull that single number out by itself, so that it's not nested in a list. Because we know _runifInt_ will return a list, we can tag on our vector index notation to pull out the single number."
